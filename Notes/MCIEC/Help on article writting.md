You are correct to be cautious. Using "I decided" or "We chose because we wanted to" can sound subjective, as if the method was picked based on personal preference rather than scientific necessity. In academic writing, particularly in engineering and computer science, the goal is to sound **objective**, **deterministic**, and **driven by the problem itself**.

Here is a guide to elevating your writing tone from "High School" to "Master's/Research" level, specifically for your bio-inspired algorithm paper.

### 1. The Golden Rule: Make the _Study_ or the _Problem_ the Actor

Instead of saying **"I"** did something, say that the **"Study"** did it, or that the **"Problem"** required it. This removes the personal bias.

- **Don't say:** "I decided to use a Genetic Algorithm because the problem is hard."
    
- **Do say:** "Given the NP-Hard nature of the route optimization problem, a **Genetic Algorithm was employed** to explore the solution space efficiently."
    
- **Do say:** "This study **proposes** a bio-inspired approach..."
    

### 2. Strategy: The Passive Voice (The "Standard" Engineering Tone)

In your previous report, you utilized phrases like "En este proyecto, utilizamos..." (In this project, we use...). While acceptable, the passive voice is often preferred in formal definitions to emphasize the _method_ over the _researcher_.

- **Don't say:** "We select the parents based on their fitness."
    
- **Do say:** "Parents **are selected** based on their fitness values."
    
- **Don't say:** "We configure the parameters as follows..."
    
- **Do say:** "The simulation parameters **were configured** according to..."
    

### 3. Strategy: Justification-Driven Selection

Never just state _what_ you chose; state _why_ the choice was inevitable. Connect the method to the problem's characteristics.

- **Weak:** "We chose Genetic Algorithms."
    
- **Strong:** "To address the non-differentiable nature of the cost function, a **Genetic Algorithm** was selected as the optimization heuristic."
    
    - _Note:_ This sounds professional because you are citing the _reason_ (non-differentiable function) rather than your _choice_.
        

### 4. Cheat Sheet: Verbs to Replace "Decide/Choose/Use"

When describing your algorithm, swap basic verbs for these high-impact academic alternatives:

|**Instead of saying...**|**Use these words...**|
|---|---|
|**"We used..."**|_Utilized, Employed, Leveraged, Implemented, Adopted_|
|**"We chose..."**|_Selected, Opted for, Prioritized_|
|**"We think..."**|_Hypothesized, Posited, Theorized_|
|**"We show..."**|_Demonstrate, Illustrate, Exhibit, Validate, Substantiate_|
|**"We made..."**|_Developed, Constructed, Formulated, Modeled, Synthesized_|

### 5. "Ready-to-Use" Sentences for Your Paper

Since your paper focuses on **Bio-Inspired Optimization for Public Transport** in Guadalajara, here are three professional ways to state your methodology, ranging from standard to sophisticated:

**Option A (Direct & Clear):**

> "This paper **employs** a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the routing of public transport. This method was **selected** for its robustness in handling multi-objective optimization problems where traditional deterministic methods fail to converge."

**Option B (Problem-Centric):**

> "Addressing the high complexity of the Guadalajara transit network requires a heuristic approach. Consequently, a bio-inspired optimiEZzation framework **was implemented**, specifically designed to minimize user travel time while adhering to operational constraints."

**Option C (Sophisticated/Passive):**

> "The proposed methodology **leverages** evolutionary computation principles. Specifically, a Genetic Algorithm is **utilized** to simulate the adaptive behavior of passenger flow, allowing for the emergence of optimized route configurations through iterative generations."

### 6. A Note on "We" vs. "I"

- **Single Author (Thesis):** Avoid "We" if you are the only author. Use "This study," "The research," or passive voice.
    
- **Multiple Authors (Conference Paper):** "We" is acceptable (e.g., "We propose a novel method..."), but it should be used sparingly.
    
- **Never use "I":** Unless you are writing a personal reflection (which is rare in engineering), avoid "I".
    

### Summary Check

Look at your `p_2.tex` file where you wrote: _"En este proyecto, utilizamos grafos..."_ (In this project, we use graphs...). **Upgrade this to:** _"This project **utilizes** graph theory to model..."_ or _"Graph theory **was employed** to create a mapping..."_

This small shift in agency immediately makes the text sound more objective and authoritative.
