Latest researched topics on the field:
In recent years, numerous research teams have  
concentrated on investigating dynamic gaits, motion stability,  
balance ability, and the high-load characteristics of quadruped  
robots, aiming to enhance their dynamic stability, motion speed,  
and transportation capacity.

#### Control of quadruped robots
**terms:**
	- **motion planning (or path planning)**: [computational problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem "Computational problem") to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination.
	- For example, consider navigating a [mobile robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_robot "Mobile robot") inside a building to a distant waypoint. It should execute this task while avoiding walls and not falling down stairs. A motion planning algorithm would take a description of these tasks as input, and produce the speed and turning commands sent to the robot's wheels
	- **gait**: the paces of animal, espacially a horse or a dog
	- **neural oscillator**: 
		- **Withe Paper**:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08753
		- **Neural oscillations**, or **brainwaves**, are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural activity in the [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system "Central nervous system"). [Neural tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tissue "Neural tissue") can generate [oscillatory activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation") in many ways, driven either by mechanisms within individual [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons "Neurons") or by interactions between neurons.
	- **Central Pattern Generator**:
		- are [self-organizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing "Self-organizing") [biological neural circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit "Neural circuit")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-2) that produce rhythmic outputs in the absence of rhythmic input.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-Hooper-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-Kuo-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-Guertin-5) They are the source of the tightly-coupled patterns of neural activity that drive rhythmic and stereotyped motor behaviors like walking, swimming, breathing, or chewing. The ability to function without input from higher brain areas still requires [modulatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation "Neuromodulation") inputs, and their outputs are not fixed. Flexibility in response to sensory input is a fundamental quality of CPG-driven behavior.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-Hooper-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-Kuo-4) To be classified as a rhythmic generator, a CPG requires:

1. "two or more processes that interact such that each process sequentially increases and decreases, and
2. that, as a result of this interaction, the system repeatedly returns to its starting condition."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_pattern_generator#cite_note-Hooper-3)
