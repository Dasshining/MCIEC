I need to find 3 different research topics over which to make a paper from, I'm currently doing a masters on electrical and computations engineering, please make a list of papers that review and concentrate the latest advances on engineering research topics such as Machine Learning, Patter recognition, Quadruped Robots and Computer Vision. My goal is to have wider view of the available topics at hand and what are the available topics to research on those fields.

I'm utilizing a genetic algorithm to look for the best path solution within a multidimensional graph, the cost function evaluated utilizes multiple cycles and conditional statements making it unfit for traditional maximization or minimization algorithms. I need to find one or multiple papers that can help me verify this or in the contrary propose a better solution for this issue.
